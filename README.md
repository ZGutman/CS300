**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
**

When it came to this course we were looking to find a way to store data related to classes in SNHU- or our fictional ABCU computer science department. We learned about different ways to store and fetch the data every week. We learned about Binary Trees, Hash tables, and Linked list. These building blocks helped us determine which was best for our final project. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
**

I started I think the way most of us are- working my way through the course. The first option we learned of early on that seemed to be the best to me was the linked list. But every method for search/storing data has it's downsides and the linked list is no different. I find it easier to understand code and system when a visual example is presented. So i took to youtube and absorbed as much as I could. The bless with programming is that there are many people who are willing to share much of their knowledge and eager to help those just starting out. 

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
**

My greatest resource when it comes to roadblocks or speedbumps is my fellow developers. I try to work in a group setting when I can so that I can grow accustomed to working on a team like I would in the real world. To do this I work with other SNHU students through a CS degree path discord server and then of course asking questions to my friends who are programmers. 

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
**

This course has really opened my eyes to the ways that data is stored. Perviously I worked on a course that delt with SQL databases and how that searches/references data from .CSV files. Secondly I had little to no experience with C++ before this course so I had to hit the ground running in this course and learn as much as I could. 

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
**

One of my biggest take aways from this course in relation to writing has been neatness. This is something I think is common amoung junior programmers, forgetting your ;, or dropping a } when you need one. This is something I struggled with before but this course I took the time to double check my code and make sure It was easy to follow and ledigible. I am not sure I always succeeded but I made a conscious effort to fix that.
